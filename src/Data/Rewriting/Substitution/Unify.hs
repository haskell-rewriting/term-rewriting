-- The setup is as follows:
--
-- We have a disjoint set forest, in which every node represents some
-- subterm of our unification problem. Each node is annotated by a
-- description of the term which may refer to other nodes. So we actually
-- have a graph, and an efficient implementation for joining nodes in
-- the graph, curtesy of the union find data structure. We also maintain
-- a map of variables encountered so far to their allocated node.

-- Each node can either represent
-- - a variable (in which case this is the only node representing that variable)
-- - an *expanded* function application with arguments represented by nodes,
-- - or a *pending* function application with normal terms as arguments,
--   not yet represented in the disjoint set forest.
